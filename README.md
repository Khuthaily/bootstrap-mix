# About
This is a template based on *Twitter Bootstrap 4* and uses *Fontawesome 5*. It utilizes the simplicity of *Laravel-Mix 2* to manage _npm_ packages.

# Why
This template is based on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/starter-template/" target="_blank">Bootstrap's Startup Template</a> but it allows you to easily and quickly:

- use `Sass` to customize *Bootstrap*
- use and manage `npm` packages
- write JavaScript using ES6/ES2015
- organize Sass/CSS and JavaScript files/modules
- minify CSS and JavaScript
- more ...

# Install
Clone the repository and then run

    npm install

# How to Use
The `src` directory is where you will manage your Sass and JS files. The `dist` directory is where you will find the `index.html` file and the outcomes of the processed `.css` and `.js` files.

The `webpack.mix.js` file is the _hub_ between your `src` and `dist` CSS and JS files.

The main commands for laravel-mix are: `npm run watch`, `npm run dev`, and (for production) `npm run prod`. Please refer to <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/docs/2.1/basic-example" target="_blank">Laravel-Mix documents</a>.

# Feedback
Needless to say, feedback and contributions will make this template better.
